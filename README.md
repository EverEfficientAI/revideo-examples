# Revideo Code Examples

This repository contains example projects built with [Revideo](https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo). If you prefer to learn by looking at code examples rather than reading through docs, this is a great place to get started with Revideo. All the individual project folders have a README - below you can find a quick summary of all projects.


### Example Projects

- **Transparent AI Avatar with Background Image:** This is a very simple example of a video of an AI avatar speaking with a background image. It is mainly meant to demonstrate how to use transparent videos in Revideo ([project folder](https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo-examples/tree/main/avatar-with-background))

- **Youtube Shorts with Subtitles:** This example project generates Youtube Shorts with AI. It generates scripts with ChatGPT, voiceovers with Elevenlabs, and background images with Dall-E. **This project has a heavy emphasis on subtitles** - here you can find a bunch of different ways to generate and animate subtitles ([project folder](https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo-examples/tree/main/youtube-shorts))
